## What is Data Rescue?

**[Data Rescue App for OSX](#)** is a robust and versatile data recovery solution designed to help users retrieve files from a wide range of storage devices, including internal drives, SSDs, USB flash drives, SD cards, and external disks. Whether data was lost due to accidental deletion, formatting, malware, system crashes, or hardware issues, **[Data Rescue](#)** provides a safe and highly efficient workflow to restore your valuable information.

The app delivers **[quick scans](#)** for recently deleted files and **[deep scans](#)** for more complicated recovery cases, giving users a high chance of successful restoration. You can preview recoverable files before recovery and selectively restore only what is needed. Supported formats include **[documents](#)**, **[photos](#)**, **[videos](#)**, **[emails](#)**, **[archives](#)**, and **[system files](#)**.

For drives showing early signs of failure, **[disk cloning](#)** and **[imaging tools](#)** allow you to create exact copies before recovery, safeguarding the original media. The software intelligently handles fragmented files, partially damaged sectors, and complex directory structures to maximize recovery success.

**Advanced capabilities** include customizable scan parameters, sector-level scanning, support for RAID and partitioned drives, automatic file organization, filtering by file type or size, and resumeable recovery sessions for large volumes of data. Optimized for Intel and Apple Silicon processors, **[Data Rescue](#)** ensures fast scanning and minimal processing time, similar to how [MacX DVD Ripper Pro for MacOS](#) benefits from Level-3 [hardware acceleration](#).
